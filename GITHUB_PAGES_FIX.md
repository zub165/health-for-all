# 🔧 Complete GitHub Pages Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Problems Identified:**

1. **Wrong IP Address**: App calls `208.109.213.95` but backend runs on `208.109.215.53`
2. **Mixed Content Security**: HTTPS frontend → HTTP backend (browsers block this)

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented:**

### **Fix #1: Correct IP Address**
- ✅ Updated `src/config/api.ts` to use `208.109.215.53`
- ✅ Updated `env.production` to use `208.109.215.53`
- ✅ All API calls now point to the correct server

### **Fix #2: HTTPS CORS Proxy**
- ✅ Created `run_https.py` - HTTPS proxy server
- ✅ Created `start_https.sh` - Startup script
- ✅ Handles mixed content security issues
- ✅ Provides CORS headers for cross-origin requests

## 🚀 **How to Use the Fixes:**

### **Option 1: Use HTTPS Proxy (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start the HTTPS proxy server
cd "/Users/zubairmalik/Desktop/Applications/Health For ALL/health-for-all"
chmod +x start_https.sh
./start_https.sh
```

This will:
- Start HTTPS proxy on `https://localhost:8443`
- Proxy requests to `http://208.109.215.53:3015`
- Handle CORS and mixed content issues
- Allow GitHub Pages to connect securely

### **Option 2: Update React App to Use Proxy**
Update your React app's API configuration to use the proxy:
```typescript
// In src/config/api.ts
return 'https://localhost:8443/api';  // Use proxy instead of direct backend
```

### **Option 3: Deploy with Correct IP (Already Done)**
```bash
# Deploy the updated React app
npm run deploy
```

## 🧪 **Test the Connection:**

### **Test 1: Direct Backend Connection**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://208.109.215.53:3015/api/health/"
```

### **Test 2: HTTPS Proxy Connection**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://localhost:8443/api/health/"
```

### **Test 3: GitHub Pages App**
Visit: https://zub165.github.io/health-for-all/
- Try AI Rapid Registration
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify data is saved to backend
